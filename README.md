These are my solutions for the exercises in [Coursera's Machine Learning Course][1], taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford University

-------------------------------
#### Topics:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
  - Neural Network Learning
  - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Means Clustering and PCA
  - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

-------------------------------
#### Stuff provided by the course and not written by me:
  - instructions in the pdf file
  - ready-to-use datasets
  - the main functions that guide the student and make calls to functions that the student will write
